# Pages Directory

The `pages/` directory contains all documentation, examples, and layout patterns presented within the Performance Hub.

Everything in this directory is intended to be **browsed, learned from, and referenced**.  

---

## Purpose of `pages/`

- Document common web patterns and approaches
- Provide clear, visual examples
- Capture repeatable solutions used across projects
- Serve as a shared learning resource for the team

---

## Directory Structure

## Folder Guidelines

### HTML
- Focuses on structure and semantic markup
- Includes examples such as forms, image layouts, and page structure
- Avoids styling beyond what is necessary for clarity

---

### CSS
- Demonstrates visual patterns and interactions
- Includes hover effects, layouts, and responsive behaviours

---

### JS
- Contains JavaScript-driven interactions and logic
- Examples should be isolated and easy to understand
- Avoid mixing unrelated behaviours in a single example

---

### BOOTSTRAP
- Documents Bootstrap-specific patterns and usage
- Shows how Bootstrap is applied within Performance projects
- Avoid duplicating generic Bootstrap documentation

---

### TEMPLATES
- Contains **full-page layout compositions**
- Combines HTML, CSS, and JS patterns into complete examples
- Represents approved layout structures and common page types

Templates should:
- Be readable and intentional
- Use patterns already documented elsewhere in the hub
- Act as reference implementations and starting points

Templates should **not**:
- Represent one-off experiments
- Include unnecessary complexity
- Duplicate simple component examples

---

### MORE
- Used for advanced, uncommon, or transitional topics
- A holding area for content that does not yet have a clear home
- Content may later be moved into another folder once patterns are established

---

## Naming & Organization Rules

- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Avoid generic names like `test.html` or `example.html`
- Prefer lowercase with hyphens for file names
- Keep related examples grouped logically

---

## Content Expectations

- Examples should be concise and focused
- Explanations should prioritize clarity over completeness
- Screenshots and visuals should be stored in `/images/` and referenced, not embedded

---

## When to Add Something New

Add a new page when:
- A pattern has been used more than once
- A solution needs to be documented for consistency
- A layout or interaction benefits from a visual reference

If a pattern is rarely used or still evolving, place it in `MORE`.

---

## Maintenance

The `pages/` directory should remain:
- Organized
- Relevant
- Aligned with real project needs

Outdated or unused examples should be revised or removed to avoid confusion.
