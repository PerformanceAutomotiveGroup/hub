# Contributing to Performance Hub

Thank you for helping improve the Performance Hub.  
This repository exists to document repeatable web patterns and layout approaches used across Performance Auto Group projects.

Keep contributions clear, practical, and intentional.

---

## Before You Add Something

Ask yourself:
- Has this pattern been used more than once?
- Will someone else benefit from this example?
- Does this already exist elsewhere in the hub?

If the answer is unclear, the content likely belongs in `MORE`.

## Where Things Go

- **HTML** → Markup structure and semantic examples  
- **CSS** → Styling, layout, and interaction patterns  
- **JS** → JavaScript behaviours and logic examples  
- **BOOTSTRAP** → Framework-specific usage  
- **TEMPLATES** → Full-page layout compositions  
- **MORE** → Advanced, experimental, or transitional topics  

If something does not clearly fit, do not force it.

## Templates Guidelines

Templates should:
- Represent full-page layouts
- Combine multiple patterns into a cohesive structure
- Reflect real use cases (Used on PAG)

Templates should not:
- Demonstrate single components or effects
- Include experimental or one-off code
- Duplicate examples already covered elsewhere

---

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames
- Separate words with hyphens
- Avoid generic names like `test.html` or `new.html`

Good:
landing-page.html
image-gallery.html
service-layout.html


---

## Code Expectations

- Keep examples focused and readable
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Comment only when it adds clarity
- Do not introduce new dependencies without a clear reason

---

## Images & Assets

- Store screenshots in `/images/`
- Use images to support explanations, not replace them
- Keep filenames descriptive

---

## Final Check

Before committing:
- Verify links and include work
- Ensure the example loads without errors
- Confirm the content aligns with existing patterns

If a contribution is confusing, it needs refinement.

---

## Maintenance

Outdated or unused examples should be updated or removed.  
The hub should reflect how work is actually done today.
